# Code for project: Dynamics of opinion formation and information spread in social networks and itâ€™s effect on overall polarization and disagreement

### To run simulations on a particular data set:

1. Specify target dataset in run_simulation.py
2. Run run_simulation.py in the terminal

### To calculate graph structure features:

1. Run calculate_graph_features.py

### To add new datasets
1. Add your data to the repo in the DATA folder
2. Set the path and target in graph_maker.ipynb accordingly
3. Run the cells in graph_maker.ipynb - Note the input expected is a list of space seperate node pairs



All figures used in the project are generated in the visulize_results.ipynb jupyter notebook. If you want to change the datasets used in run_simulation.py and calculate_graph_features.py you need to go through an edit the path shortcuts in each file as they were hard coded in this project for simplicity.
